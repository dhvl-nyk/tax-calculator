In the above project to model various products such as books, food, medical etc a common model<br/>
called Product is used. The advantage is that product is extensible to any product Type.<br/>
Also, more details can be added into current product types

For input a factory design pattern is used. Current input is static however this input can be<br/>
can be extended to Database also.

For the tax calc, I have used Strategy pattern. The advantage is that any new tax calc logic
can be easily added and the tax logic is dynamically decided at Runtime

Future Extentions: <br/> 1. Adding of dao layers to communicate with DB, service layers <br/> 2. Storing and fetching data into Db <br/> 3. Making more robust test cases <br/> 4. Adding UI to create Orders <br/> 5. Adding auth, permission, access layer etc
